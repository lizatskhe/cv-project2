# Project 2: Improving Robustness of Deepfake Detectors through Gradient Regularization

This project explores improving the robustness of deepfake detectors using **gradient regularization**, a technique that enhances model generalization by incorporating shallow feature statistics during training. The baseline model is an EfficientNet-B0 trained on a combined dataset of **DFFD and FaceForensics++**, and evaluated against adversarial attacks such as **FGSM** and **PGD**.

## üìå Project Goals

- Train a deepfake detection model using EfficientNet-B0.
- Evaluate its accuracy and generalization ability.
- Test model robustness under adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD).
- Implement and assess **gradient regularization**.

## üì¶ Dataset
Due to the class imbalance present in the DFFD dataset, we instead extracted video frames from the FaceForensics++ dataset and created a more balanced dataset by combining real and fake samples.

The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
